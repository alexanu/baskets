- Improvements on tables:

  * Virtual tables
  * Remove types
  * Remove Row, replace with accessor by attribute on regular tuple
  * See if you can make it work for beancount
  * Write full tests

- Add sectors and currencies

- Add groups of stocks, in order to aggregate exposure to BigTech strategy

- Compute additional diversification measure

- Download spreadsheet of strategies allocation (to csv) and evaluate and compare via join

- Multithread gathering

- Build reverse index: given a stock which positions does it come from

- Define STD format for list of positions

- Answer this question: Which of the available ETFs is the least correlated to mine?

- Given two portfolios, compute correlation of asset exposures between them (requires matching instruments).

- Build an instrument matcher database, using CC of the full set of available
  instruments across all ETFs. This should be used internally as a service to
  match and sanitize and normalize all reported holdings.

- Build a script to collect and print out a normalized form of the holdings.
  That in itself can be usful.

- Build a service to provide:
  * Download normalized holdings
  * Compute correlation in overlap between two ETFs or a portfolio and an ETF.
  * Disaggregate portfolio feature
  Basically all that the tools provide, but via a simple web interface.

- baskets-updatedb shouldn't have to accept a portfolio as input; it should be
  able to update everything that it has already seen in its database. However,
  the other option should remain available.
